= Block Templates =
Our Themes use block templates to display static or dynamic content. All block templates can be edited using the WordPress Gutenberg editor.

= Theme & Customizer settings =
When using a ZuestMedia WordPress Theme, various new menus and settings are added to the Dashboard and Customizer for customizing the theme.
